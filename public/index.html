If you find yourself here, you probably were given this link as a sort of reference to details about myself, and if so I would recommend checking out the <a href="#education">education</a> and <a href="#experience">experience</a> sections.</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">
                        Here are some questions that I hope to use this space to answer (hopefully accurately, certainly humerously):
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        <div class="font-weight-bold">Who am I?</div> 
                        My full name is Robert Fritz Scheidegger, and I am currently a rising first-year student at Brown University. I have always lived in the town of Queensbury in Upstate New York (not Queens, as is often mistaken), although as of this fall you will find me instead in Providence, Rhode Island. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        <div class="font-weight-bold">Who <i>really</i> am I?</div> 
                        This is always a difficult question to answer. I've often pondered what words to use when trying to accurately describe what being "me" is like (everyone knows the classic "What x adjectives would you use to describe yourself" question that finds its way into every interview ever),
                         but one that I always find fits is <b>genuine.</b> If there is something that I have always striven for, it would be to be exactly who I am at any given time, with no trickery used to make myself appear to be anything other than that. 
                         
                         <br/>
                         <br/>
                         Is this relavent to you? Probably not, but its here anyways. You're welcome.
                    </p>

                            What am I doing now?
                        </div>
                        As of this writing (July 2020), I am doing my best to enjoy the time I have between the last year of high school and my first year at Brown, while also taking time to take on some projects that I haven't found time to pursue while still in high school,
                        such as <a href="https://robert.scheideggers.com" target="_blank">this webpage,</a> the <a href="https://www.adktech.com" target="_blank">website for Adirondack Technologies, Inc</a>, and an <a href="#projects">array of others</a>. 
                        If I'm not working on these technical things, you will almost certainly find me fishing on Lake George, biking, playing spikeball, or playing my favorite game of all time: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickleball" target="_blank">pickleball</a>.
