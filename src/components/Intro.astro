      Hey! My name is Rob, and I'm an Embedded Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/tag/robotics">Amazon Robotics</a>. Previously, I studied at <a href="https://brown.edu">Brown University</a>, 
      where I received both an M.S. Computer Science and B.S. Mathematics-Computer Science in May 2024. 
    </p>
    <p class="mb-5">
      My interests in computer science are multifacited: I'm passionate about computing performance, optimization, parallelism, and algorithms,
      but I'm also fascinated by these ideas in the context of robotics, computer vision, and edge computing (hence my current position as an Embedded Software Engineer on Amazon's Safety Firmware team).
    </p>
    <p class="mb-5"> 
      I've been developing software since I was in <a href="/projects/my-first-application">middle school</a>, and have been loving it ever since. 
      Even though I started with writing simple database applications to serve various traditional business needs, 
      I've expanded my skillset and interests to performance-driven computation using cutting-edge algorithms, hardware, and ideas.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-5">
      Previously, I've worked as an intern at <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/tag/robotics">Amazon Robotics</a> on the sensor team working on low-level embedded software
      on NVIDIA Jetson compute devices, and have previously interned at <a href="https://rtr.ai/">Realtime Robotics</a> on the Appliance/Control Panel team.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-5">
      At Brown, I've been a teaching assistant for <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1951-a/">Data Science</a>, as well as a head teaching assistant (HTA) for <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1570/">Design and Analysis of Algorithms</a>
      and <a href="	http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1470/">Deep Learning</a>. I also (briefly) performed research in the theory of planar graphs under <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/pklein/">Professor Philip Klein</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-5">
      I've also acted as the Lead Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.adktech.com", target="_blank">Adirondack Technologies, Inc</a>,
      where I developed several custom full-stack business applications for businesses in Queensbury, NY area (my hometown).
