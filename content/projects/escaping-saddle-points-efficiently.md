# Escaping Saddle Points Efficiently 

This fall, I had the pleasure of taking CSCI2952Q Robust Algorithms for Machine Learning with [Professor Yu Cheng](https://cs.brown.edu/people/ycheng79/) here at Brown. The course delved deep into recent works in robust statistic, matrix completion, matrix sensing, and spectral graph theory, and motivated how such results could be used for recommender systems, networks, and much more.

As part of the course, I had to present a relevant paper to the class, so I decided to make a neat [Manim](https://www.manim.community/) presentation about _How to Escape Saddle Points Efficiently_ (you can find the original paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00887)). That presentation is linked here for your viewing pleasure:
